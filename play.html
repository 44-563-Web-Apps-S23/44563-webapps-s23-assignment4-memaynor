    <h4>The Diabolical Circle: Beulah Bornstead</h4>
    <h6>COTTON.</h6> But you must understand that marriage, my daughter, is a most
reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility.

<h6>BETTY.</h6> <p>[_Thoughtfully._]</p> <p>Truly reverend and most serious, father</p>
[_looking up roguishly_]<p>, but I like not so much of the grave about it.</p>

<h6>COTTON.</h6> <p>[_Continuing._]</p> <p>I fear thou lookest upon the matter too lightly.
It is not seemly to treat such a momentous occasion thus flippantly.</p>

<h6>BETTY.</h6> <p>[_Protesting._]</p> <p>Nay, father, why consider it at all? Marriage is
yet a great way off. Mayhap I shall never leave thee.</p>

<h6>COTTON.</h6> <p>Thou little thinkest that I may be suddenly called on to leave
_thee_. The Good Word cautions us to boast not ourselves of the morrow,
for we know not what a day may bring forth.</p>

<h6>BETTY.</h6> <p>[_Dropping her knitting._]</p> <p>Father, thou art not feeling well.

<h6>COTTON.</h6> <p>Nay, child, be not alarmed. 'Tis but a most necessary lesson to
be learned and laid up in the heart. I will not always be with thee and
I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
go.</p>

<h6>BETTY.</h6> <p>[_Picking her knitting up._]</p> <p>Be comfortably assured, then, I
prithee; I have no fears.</p>
