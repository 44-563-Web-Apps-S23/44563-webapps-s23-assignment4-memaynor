    <h6 class="cotton">COTTON.</h6> <p class="direction">[_Bringing his arm down forcibly on the arm of the chair._]</p> <p class="speech">Aye!
    There it is. Thou hast no fears. Would that thou had'st some! </p><p class="direction">[_Looks up
    at the portrait._]</p><p class="speech">Had thy prudent and virtuous mother only lived to
    point the way, I might be spared this anxiety; but, beset by diverse
    difficulties in establishing the kingdom of God in this country, and
    sorely harassed by many hardships and by evil men, I fear me I have not
    propounded to thee much that I ought.</p>
    
    <h6 class="betty">BETTY.</h6> <p class="speech">In what then is mine education lacking? Have I not all that is
    fitting and proper for a maiden to know?</p>
    
    <h6 class="cotton">COTTON.</h6> <p class="direction">[_Perplexed._]</p> <p class="speech">I know not. I have done my best, but thou hast
    not the proper attitude of mind befitting a maiden about to enter the
    married estate.</p>
    
    <h6 class="betty">BETTY.</h6> <p class="direction">[_Protesting._]</p> <p class="speech">Nay, but I am not about to enter the married
    estate.</p>
